# Shamagama — Product Overview

A self-maintaining FAQ + community Q&A portal. Combines semantic vector search, AI-powered ingestion, and an expert promotion layer so the right answer is in front of a user before they finish typing.

---

## What it does

Four zero-touch pillars, in order of automation:

1. **Ingest** — Zoom recordings, manual uploads (PDF/DOCX/XLSX/images), and webhooks feed a knowledge base. No human scheduling or categorising.
2. **Answer** — Unanswered community posts are auto-matched against the knowledge base every 24h via semantic search. High-confidence matches are auto-posted; low-confidence escalate to admins.
3. **Quality** — Approved FAQs are re-evaluated every 6h for drift, contradictions, and staleness. Drift is auto-flagged.
4. **Lifecycle** — User deletion is anonymisation, not destruction. Reputation, attribution, and audit history persist.

## Key features

- **Hybrid search** — vector + keyword + Reciprocal Rank Fusion. Auto-falls-back to keyword when vector search is empty.
- **Public FAQ portal** — no-auth browse path, batch-scoped, with popularity ranking and guest analytics.
- **Community Q&A** — posts + threaded comments + upvotes + AI auto-answer; admin escalation flow.
- **Session Support** — student issue tracker with 4-step troubleshooting checklists, evidence uploads, admin follow-ups.
- **Golden Tickets** — admin-promoted high-priority support requests with Spurti Points (SP) economy and 48h cooldown.
- **Reputation system** — points, tier ladder (newcomer → knowledge_master), auto-awarded badges.
- **Admin panel** — FAQs, users, golden tickets, support inbox, AI settings, feature flags, batches, categories.
- **Real-time observability** — tagged colored logs (`[ INFO ] [ cron ]` etc.), Discord ALERT webhook, optional Sentry.

## Tech stack (one-liner per layer)

| Layer | Pick |
|---|---|
| Frontend | React 18 + Vite + TS + Tailwind + Framer Motion |
| Backend | Node 22 + Express 4 + TS (ESM) + Mongoose 8 |
| DB | MongoDB Atlas (with Vector Search) + Upstash Redis (optional cache) + Cloudinary (uploads) |
| Search & AI | `mixedbread-ai/mxbai-embed-large-v1` (1024-dim, via HF Inference API; falls back to in-process ONNX), RRF, Atlas `$vectorSearch` |
| AI providers | Anthropic, OpenAI, XAI, MiniMax, Gemini, custom — admin-configurable per-pipeline |
| Infra | Sentry, Ngrok (webhook dev tunnel), Twilio (SMS), SMTP, Helmet, express-rate-limit, JWT, bcryptjs |

## Recent changes (v1.68)

- **Embedding model swap**: `Xenova/multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1` (768-dim) → `mixedbread-ai/mxbai-embed-large-v1` (1024-dim, SOTA MTEB 64.68). Now routed through the HuggingFace Inference API when `HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY` is set, with a fall-back to the in-process ONNX pipeline. The retrieval-tuned query prompt (`Represent this sentence for searching relevant passages:`) is auto-prepended for queries via `generateQueryEmbedding()`.
- **Schema + data audit pass** — 3 critical, 4 high, 7 medium, 6 low fixes across the 29 Mongoose models. See [`docs/schema-audit.md`](docs/schema-audit.md).
- **Race-condition sweep** — all 8 `findByIdAndUpdate` + `save()` anti-patterns in user-facing controllers (comments, bookmarks, FAQ, posts, golden tickets) replaced with atomic `$set` / `$addToSet` / `$pull`.
- **Observability overhaul** — 11 named loggers (`authLog`, `adminLog`, `cronLog`, etc.), background-colored level tags (`[ INFO ]`, `[ WARN ]`, `[ ERR ]`, `[ ALRT ]`), glyph-prefixed lines, Discord webhook forwarder with exponential-backoff retry queue.
- **Live-data seed** — `npm run seed:live` populates 20 community posts, 8 support tickets, 2 zoom meetings, badge awards, search logs, and a populated leaderboard. Idempotent.
